# ForceChainFinder
A Python-based tool designed to identify and analyze force chains in granular or particulate systems. This script processes simulation data, detects continuous paths of inter-particle forces, and provides insights into their structure and dynamics. Ideal for researchers working in granular mechanics, physics, or CFD-DEM simulations.
